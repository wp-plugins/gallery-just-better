The look & feel of the native wp [gallery] with added features: non-linkable images or linkable to external URLs; linked page viewable in a new window.

== Other Notes ==

== Usage ==

As it is a shortcode:

^ From the admin wp page->Posts/Pages->Add New or Edit, select HTML in the entry form and enter [galleryjb]
^ Attach one or more images to the post or define a PostID attribute which has attachements i.e. [galleryjb postid=123]
^ There are no mandatory attributes: it will show the attached images as a gallery if attachments are present in the current post or in postid, if postid as attribute is defined.
^ Optional attributes are all those you can see in wp 3.0.4 or 3.1 of native gallery plus:
^^ link: besides "file" (= images are linked to imagefile) and the default null string (= images are linked to the attachment's permalink) already present in wp gallery, there is now "null" (images are not clickable/linkable) and "url" (images are linked to external URLs defined in Description).
Please note that if you choose link="url", the Description textbox in Media library needs to contain a url (http(s)..etc) and not a textual description. On the other hand, Description is not used by wp native [ gallery ] in any case.
^^ target: boolean. if true linked objects open in a new/the same window, if false (default) in the same window
^^ author: true (default) or false whether you allow this plugin's author footer to be displayed or not (please, say yes).

== Examples ==

[galleryjb link="null"] ==> Images are not clickable
[galleryjb target="true"] ==> Images link to the attachment's permalink and open up in a new page
[galleryjb link="url"target="true"] ==> Images link to external URL defined in the Description textbox (in Media library). These URLs will open up in a new page.
[galleryjb link="url"] ==> Images link to external urls defined in the Description textbox (in Media library). They will open up in the same page (as default)
